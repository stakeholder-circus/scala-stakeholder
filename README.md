# scala-stakeholder

Scala deterministic parity port under stakeholder-circus.

## Status
- Full dedicated `classic-six + modern-core` is implemented locally.
- Later families are present as grouped fallback renderers.
- Full live-provider/runtime support remains a required follow-on wave.
- Local-only baseline branch remains unpublished with no upstream tracking.

## Contract
- `--list-values`
- `--focus-family <family>`
- `--output-format text|json`
- `--seed <value>`
- `--experimental-provider <provider>` fail-fast
- orphan experimental flags fail fast

## Local workflow
```bash
python3 scripts/validate_scaffold.py
sbt test stage
./target/universal/stage/bin/scala-stakeholder --list-values
```
